Hawkular is a modular systems monitoring suite, that consists of several sub-projects for
storing of metrics, alerting on incoming events and more. Those projects are developed
in their own GitHub repositories and integrated in this project.

Project website: http://www.hawkular.org (its code: https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular.github.io)

Sub-projects are currently:

* https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-metrics[Hawkular-metrics]: metric storage and retrieval engine
* https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-bus[Hawkular-bus]: asynchronous bus to connect the various parts
* https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-alerts[Hawkular-alerts]: alerting on events.
* Hawkular UI Console (a https://github.com/hawtio[hawt.io 2 plugin])
** https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-ui-services[Hawkular-ui-services]: common services and ngResource wrappers for Hawkular REST Apis.

== About this repository

In this repository we are assembling the individual pieces, sub projects and UI into
the overall Hawkular instance.

In the root `pom.xml` you can actually set the particular versions of the components, but we can't
guarantee the various permutation of component versions to work together.

== Building

To build Hawkular, clone this repository and build from the top level.

[source,shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular.git
$ cd hawkular
$ mvn install
----
Once those steps are achieved, .zip and .tgz archives will be available in `dist/target` directory.

TIP: If you build with `mvn install -Pdev`, an uncompressed directory will be created in `dist/target`.
A default user will be created, the username is `jdoe` and the password is `password`. This can be convenient
when you are working on the project as you won't have to unzip/untar and register a new user. The uncompressed directory
can be found in `dist/target/hawkular-${version}/hawkular-${version}/` and run with `bin/standalone.sh` as normally
starting a WildFly server.

Please have a look at the
http://www.hawkular.org/docs/dev/development.html[developer documentation] for more information.
